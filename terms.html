    use and incorporate such information into the City's Sites to improve User experience. </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">E. <strong>Public Records Requests.</strong>Personally identifiable information which
    is submitted upon any of the City's Sites or services or its contractors' and vendors' platforms and websites may be
    subject to disclosure to a third-party pursuant to various provisions of Idaho State and federal law, including but

  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">F. <strong>Do Not Track Signals.</strong>The City does not currently honor "do not
    track" signals issued by browsers or other third-party sources. </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">G.<strong>Third Party Tracking.</strong>Third-party companies, including but not
    limited to, Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Vimeo, Pinterest, Instagram, and LinkedIn, may track Users through
    the City's Sites as the City uses their services for social media and infrastructural purposes. It is the
    responsibility of Users to contact any Third Parties to review their individual privacy policies and "opt out"
    options. </p>

    under the age of 13. In the event that the City changes its practices of collecting, using or disclosing any
    information in a substantive way, new parental consent will be obtained. </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 60px;">3) Upon verification of a child's parent's identity, the requesting parent shall be
